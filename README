ProFTPD Log Analyzer (PFLA)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple Perl script reading ProFTPD log files and generating a sumarized
report for all containing:
  * in/out transfer statistics;
  * in/out/deleted files counts;
  * transfer type binary/ASCII counts;
  * user type counts.
The report template could be customized, but variables must be kept.
